Airline Seat Reservation System

A simple Java console program that simulates an airline seat reservation system, using basic object-oriented concepts. The program has a menu driven interface where the user can view seat availability, reserve seats, search for a passenger and displaying the passenger list.

How It Works

Seats are stored in a 2D array with each seat represented by a seat object. The driver class handles user input and menu logic with some seats already filled to demonstrate functionality.
